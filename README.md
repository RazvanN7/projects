# D Project Idea Repository
This repository is a collection of ideas for projects that will enhance the D ecosystem. Anyone in the D community may submit an idea. Projects may be picked up by anyone looking to contribute to the D ecosystem, but some may be flagged as suitable for the annual Symmetry Autumn of Code (SAOC) or Google Summer of Code (GSOC). Anyone intending to apply to either event may find a suitable project here.

There are two sets of projects:

1. A curated list that has been given the stamp of approval by the DLF. Projects in this set are deemed to align with the DLF's current goals for the language, the ecosystem, or the community. Projects in this category are described in documents that reside in the root directory of this repo.

2. A mostly uncurated list of projects that have not yet received the blessing of the DLF. This does not mean the projects aren't worth doing, only that they may not align with the DLF's current goals, or they haven't yet been properly evaluated. Projects in this set that are found [in this repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/dlang/projects/issues). Projects sutiable for either SAOC or GSOC are tagged with a label indicating such.

## Submitting a project

Everyone is welcome to submit new project ideas to [the issues list](https://github.com/dlang/projects/issues). Generally, there is no requirement that proposed projects meet requirements for any sort of time period except when considering the projects are suitable for SAOC or GSOC. Projects suitable for SAOC should keep someone busy for 20 hours/week for four months. Projects suitable for GSOC should keep someone occupied for 10&ndash;22 weeks, with 12 weeks being the ideal.

Projects proposals should be as descriptive as possible. Each proposal should contain:

* A title that indicates the end goal of the project. This goes in the title field of the issue or PR, and should also be included as the first line of any proposal document submitted as a pull request.
* A 'Description' section that provides as much detail as necessary for someone to get up and running.
* A section of rough milestones that provide further context on the project's purpose.
* A section describing the expected outcome.
* A section describing the recommended skills necessary to complete the project.
* If the project is intended for SAOC or GSOC, an optional section listing any potential mentors who have at least tentatively agreed to make themselves available.
* An optional 'Getting started' section with links to any existing documentation or other references that may be helpful to anyone taking the project on.
