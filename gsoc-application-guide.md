Thank you for your interest in applying to support the D programming language. The guidance on this page is aimed at helping you write the best application you can.

## First Steps
If you are not currently active in the D community, we encourage you to stop by our online forum and our Community Discord server to say hello. There are plenty of helpful people around to welcome you into the community and provide advice and guidance.

* Forums - https://forum.dlang.org/
* Discord - https://discord.gg/tw2c6mcKAp
* You can also contact Mike Parker at social@dlang.org for direct assistance at any stage of the process.

Before writing the application, you should have a solid idea of the project you'd like to commit to. Your project should require enough effort to keep you occupied throughout the event while also being beneficial to the D community. You can find a list of project ideas in [the dlang/project-ideas repository](https://github.com/dlang/project-ideas/). Be sure to read through the README on that page. Projects that have been committed to the root directory are aligned with the D Language Foundation's immediate goals. [Projects described in the Issue tracker](https://github.com/dlang/project-ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) might not be aligned with the DLF's immediate goals, but are sure to be of benefit to the D community.

If none of the ideas in that repository are appealing to you, feel free to propose a different project. You might also solicit ideas [in the forums](https://forum.dlang.org/) or [on the Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/tw2c6mcKAp).

With a project selected, it's time to find a mentor. Some of the project descriptions in the project ideas repository list potential mentors. If not, or if your project idea did not come from that repository, feel free to reach out in the forums, on the Discord server, or to Mike Parker (social@dlang.org) for help finding a mentor.

## The Application

Once you've settled on a project, it's time to write your application. It should contain the following information at the top:

* A descriptive title
* An email address at which we can contact you
* Your mentor's name and email address

The remainder of the application should be divided into the following sections: CV, Project Description, and an optional Extras section.

### CV
Briefly explain who you are and why you should be selected. Describe any experience you have with the D programming language and/or the language(s) you're most comfortable working with. We do not expect applicants to have prior experience with the D programming language, but we want to have a good idea of what your background is. Tell us about your experience as a programmer: programming languages you've learned, projects you've worked on, and programming-related topics you've studied. We recommend including a link to your GitHub profile if you have any existing work there that you'd like us to see.

Note that you aren't applying for a job! Your general education or work history aren't of any concern to us. We only want to get an idea of your level of programming experience.

### Project Description
In 800 words or less, describe the project that you are willing to devote several weeks to. Why did you select it? What specific goals do you want to achieve? Can it be completed within the GSoC timeframe, or will it require additional work post-event? How will it benefit the D ecosystem and/or community?

At the end of this description, include a rough set of milestones for the project. You should work with your mentor on this.

### Extras
If there is anything that might interfere with your work on this project, e.g., summer school or a job, please let us know here. Include any other information you think we should know.

## Conclusion
All of us in the D community want to see your project succeed. We'll do everything we can to help you along the way, starting with your application. Please never hesitate to ask for assistance. Good luck!
